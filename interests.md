- 🚴‍♂️ **Cycling**: I started cycling in 2025. My goal is to complete a 100-mile ride in 2026.
- 🦜 **Birding**: You can find me in Central Park during April-May and Sept-Oct in the early mornings looking for migrating birds. My favorite spot is The Pool. The rest of the year, I'm on Larkwire getting ready for the season.
