# Hobbies
- 🏃‍♂️ **Running**: An avid runner since 2015, I completed my first half marathon in 2019 and most recently ran the [2025 United Airlines NYC Half Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/13899267283){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, overcoming a challenging injury in 2023.
- 🚴‍♂️ **Cycling**: I started cycling in 2025. My goal is to ride from Manhattan to Poughkeepsie by the end of the year.
- 🦜 **Birding**: You can find me in Central Park during April-May and Sept-Oct in the early mornings looking for migrating birds. My favorite spot is The Pool. The rest of the year, I'm on Larkwire getting ready for the season.
- 🎮 **Gaming**: The [Polytopia](https://polytopia.io/polytopia-weekly-challenge/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} weekly challenge on iPhone and Mario Kart on Nintendo Switch are my go-to games.


# Continuous Learning
- **YouTube**: I enjoy educational channels like [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/@SmarterEveryDay){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Real Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@realengineering){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
- **Reading**: My interests span Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Biographies, History, and Psychology. Check out my favorites on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66203612-peter){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 
-  **Languages**: I'm a forever spanish student. No matter how much time I spend practicing, I still have difficulty speaking. Duolingo's marketing won me over.
