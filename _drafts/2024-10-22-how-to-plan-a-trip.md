# **🗺️ How to Plan a Trip ✈️**

You know where you want to go—awesome! 😎 Now it's time to figure out what you'll do once you get there. Here’s an easy way to plan your trip so you can make the most of it! Note, this is written for a couple without kids 🤗 but you can expand on it!

## Step 1: Set Up Your Planning Spreadsheet 📊

Use Google Sheets to plan your trip. It's easy to share, and you can change it whenever you need to.

Set up your sheet like this:

- **Columns**: Each day of your trip. Label them with the date and day (like "June 5" and "Monday").
- **Rows**:
  - **📍 Location**: Where you'll be that day.
  - **🏨 Hotel**: Where you’re staying.
  - **🌅 Morning, ☀️ Afternoon, 🌙 Evening**: Plan your activities and meals for each part of the day.


|                  | **Day 1**                   | **Day 2**           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **📍 Location**  | Paris                       | Paris               |
| **🏨 Hotel**     | Hotel Lumiere               | Hotel Lumiere       |
| **🌅 Morning**   | Eiffel Tower visit          | Montmartre walk     |
| **☀️ Afternoon** | Lunch at a café, Louvre tour | Seine River cruise  |
| **🌙 Evening**   | Dinner at a local bistro    | Wine bar and relax  |

Use colors to mark different categories like travel days, activities, or free time. This will help you see everything at a glance. 👀

## Step 2: Research Your Options 🔍

- **Learn**: Ask friends, watch [YouTube videos](youtube.com), review [Tripadvisor](tripadvisor.com), look at what a travel planner might book ([eg](https://www.blacktomato.com/us/destinations/#a-z-of-countries)), read blogs, and check travel guides to get ideas.
- **Make a List**: Write down everything you might want to do in a separate tab of your spreadsheet.
- **Pick Must-Dos**: Mark the activities you really don’t want to miss.

## Step 3: Slot in Activities 🕒

- **Anchor Activities**: Pick one main activity for the morning, afternoon, and evening. This could be a tour, hike, or dinner.
- **Proximity**: Plan activities that are close to each other on the same day. If you’re visiting one part of the city in the morning, do nearby things in the afternoon. This way, you save time and get to see more.
- **Mix Energy Levels**: Balance active activities (like hiking) with relaxing ones (like a spa).
- **Book Ahead**: Make a list of things that need booking in advance, like tours or popular restaurants, and put it in another tab. This way, you won’t forget important reservations. You can mark them when they're booked and assign an owner to them if needed.

## Step 4: Review your Plan 🔍
- **Leave Free Time**: Don’t overbook yourself. Keep some time open for exploring or relaxing. Focus on planning the really important things, like a famous restaurant or museum you’d be sad to miss. At most 50% of your trip should be preplanned.

## Step 5: General Advice
- **Stay Longer in Each Place**: Don’t try to see too many locations. If you’re in Europe for a week, don’t move every two days. Spend more time in each place to really enjoy it. You’ll have a better experience if you’re not rushing. 🐢

## Recap: Keep It Simple ✨

Planning your trip doesn’t mean making a rigid schedule. It’s about having a loose plan that lets you do the things you’re excited about without feeling stressed. Balance adventure with rest, keep activities close together, and stay open to surprises. 🎉

One of the best lines I got from my wife was, "Wow, this day worked out perfectly." She thought it was all spontaneous. But I smiled and said, "Did you check the spreadsheet?" 😉
