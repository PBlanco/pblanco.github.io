### What was the idea?
A marketplace for booking NYC bars and restaurants for group events, starting with large-party events like birthdays. Think “Opentable for large groups” where you select the packages and sign the contract up-front, rather than via forms and emails.

### How did we form the idea?
While having burgers at Jackson Hole in the Upper East Side, my cofounder Jin and I imagined renting the restaurant to throw our own party. But there’s no easy way to book it. That gap reminded us how painful it was to book wedding welcome events. Unclear pricing, unclear venue availability, and slow replies. We saw the same problems when we and our friends tried to book NYC bars and private dining rooms for birthday parties. We realized we could make bookings easier for birthday parties, weddings, and other group events.

### What did we try?
We marked the start of our company by creating a Slack workspace on June 12th, 2025. We focused on enabling instant booking at NYC bars and private dining rooms for birthday parties. We envisioned a mobile-friendly search engine for finding NYC bars and restaurants. One that displays private event spaces, packages, real-time pricing, and availability, all with instant booking.

We quickly validated the idea with friends who have also gone through the existing process: Submitting a form, receiving availability and a PDF with details over email, selecting the packages, and finally e-signing the contract. It seemed a no-brainer: consumers preferred the seamless and transparent approach. So, we scraped venues that were in trusted lists like Infatuation and Timeout, and what we knew was trendy. We created a landing page [getthirdspaces.com](http://getthirdspaces.com), and an Instagram account. We were ready to go.

We based the initial market size on a fee-based pricing model for confirmed bookings. This was a fairly large opportunity in NYC alone. We realized our model depended on venues using the platform… without them, we couldn’t take a fee. So, we pivoted the initial search engine plan to instead focus on a tool that helps bars/restaurants manage their private events inquiries. Thus, they maintain the pricing and availability data we need for the consumer experience, and we can charge for confirmed bookings.

We started a spreadsheet to track outreach and began cold-calling bars near us. We also visited bars and became friends with a bartender who was kind enough to derail our research by giving us free drinks. We quickly learned our main competition was inaction, such as using email (maybe a form), phone, or walk-ins. Second, was Tripleseat, a heavy-weight event CRM platform. We also saw some newer companies like PerfectVenue and WaltzIn used.

From these conversations, we learned:

* **No clear dissatisfaction among bars and restaurants:** Event managers using Tripleseat are content. Those not using software are also content.  
* **Decision-makers are hard to reach:** The software buyer is the owner or management company. It’s harder to get in contact with them than the event manager.  
* **Lack of urgency for transparency:** Bars and restaurants aren’t concerned with public-facing pricing. It’s not available because they haven’t found the need to make it available.

We also spoke with a few folks who have worked on similar event booking tech companies and learned:

* **Corporate event demand remains soft:** Revenue growth is slower than expected, largely because corporate events haven’t returned to pre-COVID levels. We reasoned this is the main revenue driver for these startups.  
* **High CAC from labor-intensive sales:** Customer acquisition costs are high, often due to the hands-on effort needed for sales and onboarding.  
* **Event coordinators avoid instant booking:** Pricing, packaging, and availability info need to be kept up-to-date for instant booking to be reliable, so users often don’t use the feature to avoid this hassle. They also want to maximize revenue per event, which is perceived as less effective when using instant booking. For example, raising prices when they recognize a corporate email.  
* **Percentage-based pricing models don’t stick:** Venues will bypass the platform to avoid booking fees, pushing software companies towards a monthly subscription model instead. Also, restaurants typically prefer their own payment systems, likely due to lower credit card processing fees than Stripe’s 2.9%, further reducing the opportunity for booking fees.

After learning about these headwinds, we still proceeded to build prototypes to demo and sell to bars and restaurants. We had three iterations with different flows, quickly learning event booking is a messy process. Two major decisions we had to make were: 

1. **Solution approach:** Focus on simplifying packaging and try to re-educate owners when we sell them ThirdSpaces, v.s. try to support their various packaging approaches.  
2. **Target customer:** Focus on bars only v.s. restaurants only to start, due to their different structured booking flow.

In the end, we decided to stop working on ThirdSpaces.

### Why we’re stopping

We found a problem.

1. **But not a big enough one.** Coordinating events is neither frequent nor painful enough for venues to adopt dedicated software.  
2. **But not a workable solution.** Consumer experience depends on up-to-date venue data, but most venues aren’t incentivized to maintain it. Booking flows also vary widely, which adds complexity to the product.  
3. **But not a sustainable business.** Restaurants and bars run on thin margins and often change ownership, making recurring revenue difficult to maintain. Meanwhile, high CAC from complex sales and onboarding further limits profitability.  
4. **But no clear product differentiation.** ThirdSpaces doesn’t stand out. Competitors like TripleseatDirect and PerfectVenue Instantbook are ahead, and even they seem to struggle to gain traction.  
5. **But no clear early adopters.** Most venues avoid early-stage tools. The only viable path would be to co-develop the product with a venue from day one.

### So, what did we learn?
First, **marketplaces only work when both sides care.** Consumers want speed in booking, simplicity in picking packages, and fairness in pricing. They’d happily use ThirdSpaces. But, venues aren’t incentivized to change and digitize, thus we don’t have the data for the consumers. Jumpstarting this marketplace is difficult. We respect how PerfectVenue is directly taking on Tripleseat’s CRM business to get the restaurants on their platform before they make their shift to instant booking one day soon [book.perfectvenue.com](http://book.perfectvenue.com).

Second, **taking action quickly uncovers information quickly.** If you want to learn about a competitor, request a demo and reach out to them on LinkedIn. If you want to talk to the users, reach out to them, go meet them where they are, and get a warm intro from another person who will talk to you. If you want to have a landing page, choose a domain and launch it quickly. Just keep making forward progress and you’ll be surprised how much you can learn and time you can save in the long run.

Third and last, **use AI sparingly** for anything other than web searches. Seriously, I know every LinkedIn post says the opposite. But, true breakthrough learnings come from talking with real people and connecting your own dots. Don’t use AI to give you fake user feedback that validates your assumptions (confirmation bias). Don’t use AI code generation (slot machines) to create infinite prototypes. Be deliberate and use your brain – this will be faster in the long run.

### What we’d do differently next time

1. **Start with what we know.** If we don’t, find someone with firsthand knowledge who’s willing to work with us from day one before committing to build anything.  
2. **Find a way to secure a pilot customer before writing code.** If you must code, only write code that will help you secure a pilot customer.  
3. **Tailor the prototype to who you’re selling to.** Keep it simple, like mocks or a small demo, just to spark a conversation.  
4. **Keep checking whether you’re building a sustainable business.** Some problems are real, but live in markets too small to support a business.

### Final thoughts

* We felt the problem ourselves and still believe there’s an opportunity for the right founder to solve it.  
* Thanks to everyone who shared time and insights with us. We learned more than we could have imagined.  
* Everyone should explore unfamiliar industries. Building for restaurants showed us a world far removed from enterprise B2B tech and taught us how differently things work on the ground. 

We’ll carry these lessons into whatever we build next.
