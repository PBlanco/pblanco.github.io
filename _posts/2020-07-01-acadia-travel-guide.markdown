**tl;dr An old guide to Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine.**

## Travel Up from New York City  
- **Lunch in Portland, Maine**: Stop at *Duckfat* for incredible poutine.  
- **Scenic Route**: After Portland, skip I-95 all the way. Instead, take I-295, then switch to US-1 near Brunswick for a picturesque coastal drive. Adds about an hour but worth it.

## Where to Stay  
- **Short Trips**: Stay near Bar Harbor. It’s the main hub with restaurants and nightlife, and you can walk back after drinks.  
- **Longer Trips**: Anywhere on the island works.  
  - We stayed near Southwest Harbor, which felt more authentically "Maine" with fewer crowds.  
  - Perks: Quiet area, fire pit, tasty lobster shack nearby, and close to Seawall Campground for scenic dinners.

## Town Vibes  
- **Bar Harbor**: Main tourist hub with lots of restaurants, nightlife, and close to major hikes (10-20 min drive).  
- **Northeast Harbor**: Upscale vibe with fancy homes; feels like the Hamptons.  
- **Southwest Harbor**: Quaint and quiet. Great if you want peace, but it’s 30-40 minutes from the main hikes.

## Top Hikes (Ranked)  
1. **Beehive Trail**  
   - Iconic hike with metal rungs for climbing—great adrenaline rush! Includes a beautiful pond-side trail.  
2. **Sand Beach**  
   - Near Beehive, one of Maine's rare sand beaches. Perfect for a post-hike stroll.  
3. **Beech Cliff Trail (via Beech Cliff Loop)**  
   - Quick 1.5-mile hike with steep ladders and stunning views at the top. Great for a lunch break.  
4. **Gorham Mountain**  
   - Easier than Beehive but just as fun. Offers ocean views and optional adventurous cliff-side detours.  
5. **Thunder Hole**  
   - Dramatic rock formation with splashy waves. Timing is key; it wasn’t very loud when we visited.  
6. **Bar Island Walk**  
   - During low tide, walk across the sandbar to Bar Island. The island’s hike is average, but the sandbar experience is unique.  
7. **Jordan Pond + Bubbles**  
   - Popular but crowded. Scenic views and a chance to try popovers at Jordan Pond House (if it’s not too busy).
