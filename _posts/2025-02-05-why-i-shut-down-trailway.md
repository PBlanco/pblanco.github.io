I started Trailway to solve a pain I’d felt as a Product Manager: **spending about 20% of my time testing features before release**. I believed I could automate this to reduce PM workload and accelerate shipping.

I pitched this idea to Antler in NYC and was accepted into their residency program. I joined their Fall 2025 cohort to validate this thesis.

Over the course of building and testing Trailway, I learned a few hard truths:
1. **The pain was real but not urgent:**
- PMs knew it was a time sink, but rarely made it a priority. Most tried to delegate, then still double-checked others' work, so they still spent about the same amount of time.
- Engs didn’t feel this pain. PMs or QA handled it. Engs cared more about code-based regression testing.
- When QA teams existed, they treated this as part of their job. But saw regression testing, test maintenance, and case management as the bigger problems.
    
1. **There was no clear owner:**
- In teams with just Engs and PMs, no one officially owned release testing. PMs did the testing but hesitated to officially take on that role, as new tools would have made that responsibility explicit.
- When QA teams existed, they handled release testing, but PMs still double-checked. QA teams rarely had the influence or budget to bring in new tools.
    
1. **The problem was messy and context-dependent:**
- Every company’s SDLC process was different, making a one-size-fits-all solution difficult.
- Building a highly technical solution as a solo founder slow and exhausting.
- I couldn’t find early adopters because the prototypes were too vague and not solving urgent problems.

Takeway: Problems lacking urgency, clear ownership, and dedicated budget are difficult to turn into sustainable products.

In the end, I gradually lost conviction. Without clear pull from the market or a co-founder to share the journey, I couldn’t sustain belief in the direction.

I’m grateful I had the chance to explore a problem I care about. Thank you to the people I met in the Antler program, the folks who took meetings with me for research and advising, and my friends and family who were my sounding board throughout.
